# Module 14 Challenge

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to take a look at the Citibike user data in New York City to determine if the program is worth investing in at another location. 

## Results
See Tableau story. 

## Summary
The results of this analysis show that trips are taken majority by male subscribers, during commute hours, for short rides under 30 minutes. Two additional visualizations I included were total rides and the top starting location. 

If I were to perform more analyses, I'd download a datatset to analyze the population and commute times for different age groups of a city considering implementing a citibike propgram in their city. I would also take a look at the number of people taking ridesharing apps and the availablility of public transportation. Cities with low access to public transportation and high rideshare ridership would likely benefit from a citibike implementation.
